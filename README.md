# argentous-oxide
*Homebrew gameboy emulator written in Rust. Named after silver (I) oxide, for the Gameboy's classic silver shell.*

This program is written for purely educational purposes, I have not done any reverse engineering and everything came from the fantastic pandocs: https://gbdev.io/pandocs/.<p>
*- Included in this repo is a copy of Pokemon: Blue version, also for educational purposes. If it's a problem please contact me, and I'll remove it posthaste.*
